This repository stores frequently re-used scripts for ingesting, analyzing, and visualizing a wide array of bioinformatic data (mainly genomic based assay data, i.e. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, also chromatin contact (3C)). 
***
**Organization**: \
`3C-methods` - analysis scripts and other code for working with 3C-based assays (Hi-C, HiChIP, MicroC, etc.) \
`genomic_analyses/` - scripts for differential expression testing and super enhancer identification. \
`ORCA/` - scripts for analysis of ORCA data and simulated ORCA traces. *All code related to polymer simulations is here*.\
`scripts/` - miscellaneous scripts for file conversion, data preprocessing, and others.
