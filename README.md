This repository stores frequently re-used scripts for ingesting, analyzing, and visualizing a wide array of bioinformatic data (mainly genomic based assay data, i.e. RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, also chromatin contact (3C)). 
***
### **Structure**: 
#### 
`3C-methods/` - analysis scripts and other code for working with 3C-based assays (Hi-C, HiChIP, MicroC, etc.) \
`compbio/` - scripts for differential expression testing, super enhancer identification, and 3D hub formation. \
`ORCA/` - scripts for analysis of ORCA data and simulated ORCA traces. *All code related to polymer simulations is here*.\
`scripts/` - miscellaneous scripts for file conversion, data preprocessing, plotting/data visualization, etc.

#### Other repositories
Not all of my code/projects at Penn are housed here. They can be found at:
* https://github.com/faryabiLab/dockerize-workflows - Containerized and reproducible NGS processing pipelines.
* https://github.com/Nuwah12/EBV_Project - Code related to a project surrounding the interaction of an MCL cell line's genome with the Epstein-Barr Virus episome (coming soon, currently under construction).
* https://github.com/Nuwah12/Demo-RNAseq-Pipeline - Simple step-by-step RNA-seq processing pipeline made as a teaching tool for non-computational coleagues.
