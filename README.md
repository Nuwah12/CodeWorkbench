# Repository of analysis scripts
This is a repository I use to store analysis scripts that get re-used frequently. 
***
**Organization**: \
`genomic_analyses/` - scripts for differential expression testing and super enhancer identification. \
`ORCA/` - scripts for analysis of ORCA data and simulated ORCA traces. *All code related to polymer simulations is here*.\
`scripts/` - miscellaneous scripts for file conversion, data preprocessing, and others.
