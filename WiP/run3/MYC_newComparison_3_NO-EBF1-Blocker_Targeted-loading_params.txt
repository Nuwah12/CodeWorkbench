This simulation removes all EBF1 blockers and loads cohesin in a targeted manner at the EBF1 sites (12 random LEF + 3 targeted = 15 total LEF). Chromatin jets can be observed at E2 and B3, which are both targeted extruder loading sites without nearby blockers, which is a known jet formation mechanism. E1.2 loads cohesin with nearby CTCF, thus no jet is formed.
