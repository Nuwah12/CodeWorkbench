The version of GENOVA used here is in a [forked repository](https://github.com/Nuwah12/GENOVA2), it was changed so that it can accept different normalization fields within the `.cool`/`.hic` files. \
Installation of the fork is the same as the original repository - follow the instructions in the README.
